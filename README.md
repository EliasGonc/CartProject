# Shopping Cart Project
This is my implementation of one the two ideas proposed for the final project of my Object Oriented Programming course. You can check out a demonstration video (in Brazilian Portuguese) at https://youtu.be/jzzhvjKlgtE.

## The project
The program should simulate a shopping with following features:
- Add products
- See what's in the cart
- See what's the total price

The products, however, have to be registered first. Not only that, but each must have a supplier which the also have to be registered.

## The implementation
The final program uses a terminal console interface where the user must select an option by entering a menu item number.
